Project Title:
Job Marketplace Platform (Demo Version for Albania)

Goal:
Build a web-based demo platform for a modern job marketplace in Albania. The design must prioritize easy user experience above all else. Both job seekers and employers should find it intuitive, fast, and simple. The style should feel Apple-like: modern, clean, minimalistic, but not empty or too plain.

Color Palette:

White (primary background for clarity)

Light Blue (UI highlights, secondary backgrounds, buttons)

Dark Blue (accents, headers, call-to-actions)

Core Features for Demo (MVP):

Homepage:

Clear tagline (e.g. “The easiest way to find and apply to jobs in Albania”).

Prominent “Post a Job” button (for employers) and “Find a Job” button (for seekers).

Modern hero section with background illustration or subtle animation.

Simple navigation bar (Home, Jobs, Employers, Login/Register).

Job Seeker Flow:

Sign up / Login (basic form: name, email, password).

Profile Page: upload CV, enter personal details, skills, experience.

“Apply with 1 click” button for jobs (auto-fills profile info).

Option to apply by filling custom fields if extra info is required.

Job search page with filters (location, job type, salary, category).

Employer Flow:

Sign up / Login (basic form: company name, email, password).

Employer Dashboard:

Post a job (title, description, salary, location, requirements).

Manage posted jobs (edit, delete).

View applicants for each job (list of profiles with CV link).

Notifications & Communication (basic demo):

Email or in-app notification when someone applies to a job.

Design System / UX Guidelines:

Apple-inspired: clean typography, simple layouts, intuitive spacing.

No clutter: only necessary info shown on each screen.

Responsive: mobile-friendly from the start.

Buttons large, clear, and high contrast (white/light blue backgrounds with dark blue text or vice versa).

Use icons subtly (not overloaded) to guide actions.

Monetization (for demo – placeholder only):

Employers pay per job posting → show “Add Payment Method” placeholder page.

Job seekers always apply for free.

Technical Notes (Demo Scope):

No need for full payment integration (just mock it).

Keep backend simple (demo data or mock API).

Ensure flows are clickable and demonstrate the concept.

Future Vision (for context only, not needed in demo):

AI job matching.

Mobile app.

Premium features for both seekers and employers.
